    "description": "There is more than one American Dream. Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams.\r\n\r\nSome of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nThis is a new mindset.\r\n\r\nWe are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms \"landlord\" and \"tenant\" don't apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them.\r\n\r\nOur owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants.\r\n\r\nWe manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community.\r\n\r\nSo, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots for however long you're planning to be there, we are the answer.\r\n\r\nRenting is the new American lifestyle. We didn't create it, but we're making it sing.",

The majority of cryptocurrencies sit idle on exchanges and in wallets, yielding no interest. At Compound, we're creating interest rate markets to unlock the value of these assets, empowering investors with new opportunities to profit. We are developing an Ethereum protocol that establishes money markets with algorithmically set interest rates. Compound algorithmically adjusts money market interest rates based on asset-specific supply and demand. That means that for the first time, users and applications can frictionlessly exchange the time value of Ethereum assets without having to negotiate terms, rates, or complex flows. Each money market is transparent, auditable, and completely predictable; perfect for profit-seeking humans and machines alike.",

Unlike other projects in the space which are glorified research projects or hand-wavy marketing pitches, NEAR is being built by a global collective of world champion competitive programmers and successful entrepreneurs who know how to take technology to market.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for only the very best, world-class engineers and startup veterans to join this journey.

They insert a few lines of python code (extending to Java soon) into the application code to fetch the relevant data and run queries on a grid sitting on top of AWS.  Apparently (which was news to me), 25% of AWS's instances are in fact HPC today.  The vision - which may sound familiar - is to ultimately offer Computing Power as a Utility\n\nDoes the product exist:  Yes - in beta\n\nMetrics:  1,700 beta users today\n\nAmount Raised:  $35k grant from Lightspeed in Jan 09\n\nAmount raising:  $650k seed round\n\nEnthusiasm:  8 - very smart entrepreneurs with a very simple value prop today, but with a strong vision for how to make this a general purpose public or private cloud platform.",

Annual reviews never have enough context, and both employees and managers forget what actually happened.  Reflektive gives employees and managers a platform to provide each other with positive and constructive feedback immediately,  creating a culture and expectation of accountability. The data that is gathered in the process is meaningful and useful, and the process makes team members feel more engaged, connected, and productive.  Other platforms tackle pieces of this process, but they do it in an old-fashioned, linear way.  Reflektive is the first product that focuses on a holistic, 360° review process.",

    "description": "Shield AI's mission is to protect service members and innocent civilians with artificially intelligent systems.\r\n\r\nOur initial focus is on the last several miles of the battlefield where we lack capability to collect intelligence. This area is beyond the view of high altitude sensors, too dangerous for people, and too complex for robots to navigate. Consequently, service members are asked to make life altering decisions with limited information. Mistakes are made that cost lives and incur massive collateral damage. Such mistakes cause the United States to lose support of local populations and make conflict unwinnable. This problem is widely recognized throughout the DoD, including the most senior leadership.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, we are building swarms of small intelligent robots to collect the critical missing information. The systems will scour indoor and outdoor spaces in search of threats and innocent people. They will be deployed by people, trucks, ships, aircraft, and other robots. These robots will become more numerous in combat areas than soldiers. Synthesized information will be presented to service members who will be empowered to make decisions leading to intended outcomes without collateral damage. Conflict becomes less brutal.",
