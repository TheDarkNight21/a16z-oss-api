  "description": "At Wonderschool, our mission is to provide quality child care to every child in the world. There is a major shortage of affordable childcare and preschools in the United States; and at the same time, many early childhood educators and young parents struggle to make ends meet. Wonderschool empowers current and aspiring in-home care providers with all the tools and support they need to start, run, and grow a childcare business in their home. By lowering the barriers to entry, we believe we can dramatically increase the supply of quality, affordable care. Wonderschool's platform connects families searching for care with our network of care providers.",
