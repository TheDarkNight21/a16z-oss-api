  "description": "A new desktop virtualization solution that runs on existing devices by creating micro-VMs; every time the user initiates a new transaction, they create a thin in-memory clone of a VM state; everything is isolated in its in full-OS container; does not require the install of a native hypervisor on top of the core OS; uVMs are designed to be ephemeral + garbage collected (although you can save a state if you like); solution is completely secure because all transactions run in a uVM and all read/writes to VM0 (your pristine OS state) need to be approved by policy or the user.",
