  "description": "<b>What we do</b><br><br>\n\nHuman error in construction costs the world about $3 Trillion/yr and is largely responsible for over 50% of construction projects running over schedule. <br><br>\n\nUsing 3D computer vision and deep learning, our software turns off the shelf sensors into error detection tools for construction projects - giving project managers superhuman powers to spot critical issues that they otherwise couldn't. <br><br>\n\nThis significantly reduces costs, and more importantly reduces the risk of a project running over schedule.<br><br>\n\n<b>Who we are</b> <br><br>\n\nWe're a team of geeks from Stanford and UMich who are passionate about applying computer vision to dusty industries that have been neglected by technology.",
