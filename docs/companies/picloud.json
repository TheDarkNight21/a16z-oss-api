  "description": "Referral Source:  Cold email to Marc A\n\nFounder Sketches:  2 '08 CS grads from Berkeley\n\nBasic idea:  Enabling HPC customers today (have the vision to make this generally available to all cloud application) to access a cloud grid.  They insert a few lines of python code (extending to Java soon) into the application code to fetch the relevant data and run queries on a grid sitting on top of AWS.  Apparently (which was news to me), 25% of AWS's instances are in fact HPC today.  The vision - which may sound familiar - is to ultimately offer Computing Power as a Utility\n\nDoes the product exist:  Yes - in beta\n\nMetrics:  1,700 beta users today\n\nAmount Raised:  $35k grant from Lightspeed in Jan 09\n\nAmount raising:  $650k seed round\n\nEnthusiasm:  8 - very smart entrepreneurs with a very simple value prop today, but with a strong vision for how to make this a general purpose public or private cloud platform.",
